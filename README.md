# Domain Modelling Discussion Questions

### Discuss these questions with your fellow table mates and try to model some solutions to the questions  


##### Using Netflix as your model, think about/try to model some solutions for the following questions:

1 . What would a User table look like? What columns do you think would be in the table?

2 . How would you model the relationship between a User and it's Queue? What kind of properties would a Queue have? What kind of relationships would a Queue have with other tables?

3 . A Movie has a plot, title, rating, duration, actors/actresses, and reviews. How would you model each these relationships with a Movie. What would would you call the relationship between an Actor and a Movie?

4 . A User can have many Movies that belong to their Favorites? Why can multiple User's have the same Movie in their favorites.

5 . If a Reviewer does not have a direct relationship to a Movie, how can a Movie list the names of it's Reviewers? What would you call this relationship?

6 . Would a Review be a property of a User or it's own table? Why?
